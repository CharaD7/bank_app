# Pull Request Creation Instructions

## Overview

This document provides step-by-step instructions for creating a pull request from your fork (CharaD7/bank_app) to the original repository.

## Steps to Create a Pull Request

1. **Visit the Pull Request Creation URL**

2. **Select the Base Repository**

   On the pull request creation page:
   
   - GitHub should automatically detect that your repository is a fork
   - In the "base repository" dropdown, select the original repository (not your fork)
   - Ensure the "base" branch is set to the main branch of the original repository (usually `main` or `master`)
   - Ensure the "compare" branch is set to `feat/crit_implements`

3. **Fill in the Pull Request Details**

   Provide a descriptive title and detailed description for your pull request:
   
   **Title Example:**

## After Creating the Pull Request

1. **Monitor the Pull Request**

   - Watch for any comments or requested changes from the maintainers
   - Be prepared to make additional changes if requested

2. **CI/CD Checks**

   - If the repository has CI/CD configured, ensure all automated checks pass

## Additional Notes

- If you're unsure about the original repository URL, check the repository's GitHub page or contact the project maintainers.
