- **✅ Metadata Support**: Rich metadata for detailed activity tracking

#### Notification Service (`lib/appwrite/notificationService.ts`)
- **✅ Notification Management**: Create, read, update, archive notifications
- **✅ Real-time Notifications**: Live notification updates and read receipts
- **✅ Notification Analysis**: Unread counts, statistics by type
- **✅ Bulk Operations**: Mark all as read, batch operations
- **✅ Smart Subscriptions**: Unread-only subscriptions for efficiency

### 5. UI Integration
- **✅ Cards Component Update** (`app/(tabs)/cards.tsx`):
  - Migrated card creation to use Appwrite service
  - Updated to use new card data structure
  - Maintained existing UI/UX patterns
- **✅ React Hook** (`hooks/useAppwriteCards.ts`):
  - Custom hook for real-time card subscriptions
  - Automatic card loading and state management
  - Error handling and loading states

### 6. Service Integration (`lib/appwrite/index.ts`)
- **✅ Centralized Exports**: Single import point for all Appwrite services
- **✅ Type Exports**: Complete TypeScript interface exports
- **✅ Service Aggregation**: Default export with all services organized

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Using Real-time Cards
```typescript
import { useAppwriteCards } from '@/hooks/useAppwriteCards';

function CardsList() {
  const { 
    cards, 
    activeCard, 
    isLoading, 
    setActiveCard 
  } = useAppwriteCards({
    onBalanceChanged: (cardId, newBalance) => {
      console.log(`Card ${cardId} balance updated to ${newBalance}`);
    }
  });

  return (
    // Your card UI with real-time updates
  );
}
```

### Creating Transactions with Real-time
```typescript
import { createTransaction, subscribeToTransactions } from '@/lib/appwrite/transactionService';

// Create transaction
const transaction = await createTransaction({
  cardId: 'card123',
  type: 'deposit',
  amount: 100.00,
  description: 'ATM deposit',
  category: 'income'
});

// Subscribe to real-time transaction updates
const unsubscribe = subscribeToTransactions({
  onTransactionCreated: (tx) => console.log('New transaction:', tx),
  onStatusChanged: (id, newStatus) => console.log(`Transaction ${id} status: ${newStatus}`)
});
```
